Create a column of normal distributed random numbers with a 1000 elements.
The mean should be 0 and the standard deviation 3.

Create a second column based on the first column with the following formula:
    y = 1 / x

Create a third column based on the first column with the following formula:
    y = sin(x)

Create a fourth column based on the first column with the following formula:
    y = shiftright(x, 10)  # rotate the values 10 steps to the right

"""

"""
Assume each column is a time series with a sampling rate of 100 Hz.
Plot all columns in one plot with a legend and correct axis labels.
"""


"""
Select all the rows from the first column that are larger than the respective rows in the second column. 
"""

"""
Compute the cosine of all rows of the first column with the respective rows in the third column larger than 0.5.
"""


"""
Bonus:
Assume the columns are time series with a sampling rate of 100 Hz.
Compute the spectral density of the first column.
Compute the cross spectral density between the first and sixth column.
Plot the cross spectral density and identify the dominant frequency.
